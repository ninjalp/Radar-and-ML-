This repository is dedicated to processing multi-sensor data and applying machine learning techniques for applications such as activity recognition, object detection, anomaly detection, and environmental monitoring. By leveraging sensor data from sources like IMUs, cameras, radar, and more, this project aims to build intelligent models capable of accurate real-time analysis and predictions.
